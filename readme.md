This is an example project to understand gitHub

It creates a simple polynomial fit of randomized data and a plot
using numpy and matplotlib

Used the procedure from:
    https://github.com/mjhea0/thinkful-mentor/blob/master/git-workflow.md

Basic Git/Github Workflow
    Setting up a Repository
    Starting a new project
    Create project directory on local machine
    In terminal, navigate to newly created directory
    Create a new git repo: git init
    Add a readme.md file that states what the project is all about: touch readme.md
    Add a .gitignore file: touch .gitignore
    Add files to staging: git add -A (taking a snapshot)
    Add files (snapshot) to local repo: git commit -m "commit message"
    Go to Github and add a new repository
    After you create repo, copy the "remote add" line, then paste back within your project directory in your terminal
    Now push your local repo to Github: git push origin master

Updating an existing project
    After you make your updates, add files to staging git add -A (taking a snapshot)
    Add files (snapshot) to local repo: git commit -m "commit message"
    Now push your local repo to Github: git push origin master
    
This is another change....
And this is a local change pushed with Github Desktop....
